# TB-Troop-Calculator
Calculator to figure out troop sizes for various levels.


Basic Python script that I made, with a simple GUI, with a generous amount of help with AI related tools. Put in the total about of troops at the top(Capacity as I refer to it as), then select which levels you want to include. After that, press Calculate and it will display the troop numbers below. 

This is a very much work in progress. The level selection at the moment is kind of useless, as it's more of "How many levels am I sending?" Rather than "If I send Level 1, then it will know the correct level 3's and 4's to send based off of their health if I select 1/3/4." The latter is my goal, because if monsters attack the highest group of health first, then factoring the amount of a type of troops to send based off of their health, will grant you more higher level troops than the level below, and give you more strength in the fight. That will be V.2, as that's a complete overhaul. I'm also going to add in the ability to select which type of warrior you're going to send, because you might only want to send Archers, Riders, and/or Spearman.

This is available to all. Feel free to branch it and make changes to it. Let me know if you have any other ideas and if they're in my wheel house, I'll try to add them.

Installation/Usage:

Windows:
I made a portable version of the script, that doesn't require installing anything or needing to know how to use python.
1. Download "Portable Version for Windows" I've included a zipped and an unzipped copy, whatever is easy for you.
2. Unzip the file if you downloaded that copy, otherwise.
3. Open the folder and navigate to "dist".
4. Click on 'tb_troop_calculator'.
5. The calculator will open and ready to use.

Manually running the script:
1. Make sure to have Python 3.10 or newer installed.
2. Open a CMD window, and cd to the directory where the .py file is located.
3. Once in the same directory, run 'python tb_troop_calculator.py'
4. Would likely skip these steps if you never used python before. Might need to install tkinter to make it work if you don't already have the package installed. 'pip install tkinter'

Mac:
Unfortunately don't have access to a Mac computer right now, so you're on your own.
