# TB-Troop-Calculator
Calculater to figure out troop sizes for various levels.


Basic Python script that I made, with a simple GUI. Put in the total about of troops at the top(Capacity as I refer to it as), then select which levels you want to include. After that, press Calculate and it will display the troop numbers below. 

This is a very much work in progress. The level selection at the moment is kind of useless, as it's more of "How many different levels am I sending?" Rather than "If I send Level 1, then it will know the correct level 3's and 4's to send bases off of their health if I select 1/3/4." The latter is my goal, but as of now, it's just a "Send 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, different level troops at a time.

This is available to all. Feel free to branch it and make changes to it. Let me know if you have any other ideas and if they're in my wheel house, I'll try to add them.
